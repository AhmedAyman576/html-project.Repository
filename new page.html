 Scientists at the University College London can access a number of the most powerful computers in the world, and the British University team works with more than 100 researchers from all over the United States and Europe to make the most of these computers in the battle against the "Covid 19" epidemic.
</p>
<p>
Scientists and researchers are using super supercomputers known as "super computers" all over the world to accelerate the search for a cure for the Coronavirus, which has entered the world in a state of closure and disrupted social, economic and commercial life.
</p>
<p>
Researchers at University College London say supercomputers can process information, which can take months in normal circumstances, within days.

<p>
This means that it can quickly examine and treat "potential antiviral drug libraries", including drugs that have already been licensed to treat other diseases, according to a report published in the British "Daily Mail".
Therefore, computer engineering has a big and important role, God willing, in finding a solution to this pervasive virus that has lost thousands of lives
