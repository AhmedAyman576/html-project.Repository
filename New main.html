Computer Engineering Role in COVID-19 Pandemic!
The question of how computers can contribute to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic is being posed to experts in artificial intelligence (AI) all over the world.
</p>
<p>
AI tools can help in many different ways.
 They are used to predict the spread of coronavirus, map its genetic evolution as it transmits from human to human, speed up diagnosis and potential treatment development, while also helping policymakers deal with related issues such as the impact on transportation, food supply and travel.
</p>
<p>
But Artificial intelligence is only useful in all those situations if it has enough examples to learn from. 
	
As COVID-19 has brought the world to unchartered territories, the "deep learning" systems that computers use to develop new skills don't actually have the data they need to deliver useful outputs.
